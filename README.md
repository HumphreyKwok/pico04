## Acknowledgements
Basically I designed this board on ai03's tutorial, step by step. This PCB won't even exist without the help of ai03's previous works and foorprint libraies.
On the other hand, coseyfannitutti and Hadi Iskandarani also advise me a lot during the development of this project. </br>
